# Workaround for youtube one minute stop streaming
If you can not watch youtube streams beyound one minute mark (that is it will stop buffering)

Just change the watch?v=  in the url to embed/ like so :

example: 

```https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EngW7tLk6R8```

change it to:

```https://www.youtube.com/embed/EngW7tLk6R8```

Or you can get the code and use it in terminal.
